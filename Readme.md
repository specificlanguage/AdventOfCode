# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I wouldn't call myself an "amazing" coder, but I do feel pretty good getting quick-ish and legible solutions.

Notes for the 2023 solutions:

> This is more of exercises for me, and barely a hobby project more than anything. I don't expect to get on the leaderboard at any point (since I don't stay up anyway, lol), and am mostly using this for practice, but also to start regularly committing once again. I'll mostly be uploading these at my convenience.

Approach for the 2024 solutions:

> While I am coding in Python and at least try to go for a "fast"-written solution, I don't intend to get on the leaderboard at all, these people are literally crazy. Part of the reason I'm doing it this year is because the time zone is favorable to me instead of living in the East Coast.
> In all honesty, working at a corporate job kind of makes you forget the bigger picture past all the abstractions, so just "solving a problem" fast has some appeal for me. It's either that or I'm just checking how well my Leetcode skills have held up after a year, once we get to like Day 8 or something.
